A Linear Regression and GAM Approach to the Impact of Environmental Taxes on GHG Emissions
This research paper introduces an innovative study into the dynamics of environmental taxes and their impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By utilizing a dataset that covers different regions and years we have employed both linear regression and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to extensively examine this relationship. Our approach stands out by incorporating statistical techniques, such as Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to address issues like multicollinearity and explore the complex and potentially non linear connections between environmental taxation and GHG emissions.Our findings indicate variations in the effectiveness of environmental taxes across different timeframes and geographical contexts. The linear regression model shows inverse links between environmental taxes and GHG emissions with noticeable year to year fluctuations. However it is the GAM that reveals an intricate and non linear interaction suggesting that the effectiveness of environmental taxes in reducing GHG emissions is not straightforward but influenced by various factors.Both models have limited power, which suggests the existence of other important variables not considered in our study. This highlights the necessity for a comprehensive approach to comprehend GHG emissions better. Additionally the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals of the linear model indicates that time series analysis may be applicable for analyzing this type of data.

Our research contributes to the discussion surrounding the role of environmental taxes in mitigating climate change.The knowledge acquired emphasizes the need for policy development that takes into account the intricate relationship between economic strategies and environmental results. Through an approach this research enhances our comprehension of these dynamics offering valuable insights for policymakers and researchers, in the realms of environmental economics and sustainability.
